Thanks for your interest in contributing to Formspree! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request.**

If you want to contribute but aren't sure where to start, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/formspree/formspree-react/issues).

## Prerequisites

This project uses [`yarn v1`](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager.

## Development environment

To play around with code while making changes, you can run the local development environment:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will run an example app on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) that uses create-react-app.

The example app code is located in [`examples/cra-demo`](../examples/cra-demo). The Vite js demo is located in [`vite-demo`](../examples/vite-demo). Make sure you clean up after yourself before pushing up any changes.

## Release notes

Formspree uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and publishing.
